Correct the round-38 filing's dates: the findings are 2026-09-08, the closes and the filing
are 2026-09-09 (the three PRs merged on the 9th).

Author: Paul Calnon
Created: 2026-09-09
Status: ad-hoc — one-off (companion to util/ad-hoc/register_round38_file.py, which was written on
        the 8th and dated its own closes 2026-09-08; the PRs merged 2026-09-09T17:14Z / 17:57Z / 19:25Z)
Retire when: RETAINED — ad-hoc scripts are kept as provenance of record (owner policy 2026-08-25)

         HANDOFF_2026-09-08_defect-register-round-38-the-three-way-prompt-built-and-the-annotation-made-truthful.md

A close date is the date the fix LANDED, not the date the defect was found or the row drafted --
otherwise the register's chronology disagrees with `gh pr view --json mergedAt`, which is the only
receipt a later reader can check.
