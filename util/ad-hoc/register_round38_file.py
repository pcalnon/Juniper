Round-38 defect-register filing: §4.9 post-primer rows, three closes, two precision withdrawals
and the stale §2 operating-rule paragraph -- exact-match edits that refuse on any miss.

Project: juniper-ml
Sub-Project: ad-hoc tooling
Author: Paul Calnon
Created: 2026-09-08
Status: ad-hoc — one-off (applied once on 2026-09-08; re-runnable with --dry-run as the statement of what changed)
Retire when: RETAINED — ad-hoc scripts are kept as provenance of record (owner policy 2026-08-25)
Related: HANDOFF_2026-09-08_defect-register-round-38-the-three-way-prompt-built-and-the-annotation-made-truthful.md;
         reports/2026-09-08_round-37-consensus/ (the six lanes whose findings these rows file);
         util/ad-hoc/register_open_set.py and register_status_crosscheck.py (run on the result before writing)

What it does
------------
1. `Last Updated` -> 2026-09-08.
2. Withdraws the four-significant-figure "114.8x / 92.9x" JD-PERF-02 speed-ups at the two sites
   that still carried them (the `APD-DATA-019` row and the §4.1 correction note); only the order is
   quotable (re-measurements 96.6-180.1x and 77.4-173.2x).
3. Rewrites the §2 paragraph that still said "Both unparked rows" and named the withdrawn `total`
   remedy; adds a dated note that the §4.9 actionable rows end the "empty set" of 2026-09-03.
4. §2 status line: "Seventy-nine of the 96", the post-primer clause naming the three new FIXED ids,
   "28 open in all".
5. Inserts §4.9 "Filed after the primer" (14 rows, APD-DATA-037..044 and APD-CASCOR-007..012) with
   the row-level park / actionable sentences, before the §5 heading.
6. Inserts the three §5.1 verification rows.

It refuses to mark a row FIXED unless `gh pr view` reports the cited PR MERGED (skipped with a
warning under --dry-run), and runs the two checkers on the edited text before writing.

Rows the primer never contained, filed from later work — here, the independent-agent validation of the
round-37 defect-register handoff (six lanes, 2026-09-08; record in
`reports/2026-09-08_round-37-consensus/`). They are **not counted in the 96** above, the `Primer` column
is `—`, and each row's park status is stated in its own row-level sentence below the table (the
"Parked has three shapes" rule applies). Ids continue each repository's sequence; retired ids are never
reused. canopy findings from the same validation live in the canopy E2E ledger (`F-CANOPY-*`), not here —
the two namespaces are deliberately unrelated: the explicit-`allow_truncation: false`-on-every-apply
defect and the `val_ratio` / `INFRASTRUCTURE_FIELDS` drift are recorded in
`prompts/thread-handoff_automated-prompts/HANDOFF_2026-09-08_defect-register-round-38-the-three-way-prompt-built-and-the-annotation-made-truthful.md`
(the former CANOPY_NOTE).

| ID | Finding | Sev | Source | Primer | Conf |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| APD-DATA-037 | **FIXED ([juniper-data#388](https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-data/pull/388))** — `equities_seq` bound no deployment defaults: `dataset_id` hashed the schema defaults, so two requests under different truncation policies collided on one id (proven by execution: identical ids under `JUNIPER_DATA_EQUITIES_ALLOW_TRUNCATION` off vs on) | C | `generators/equities_seq/generator.py` (`bind_deployment_defaults`), `api/routes/datasets.py` (the `getattr` binder hook) | — | High |
| APD-DATA-038 | **FIXED ([juniper-data#388](https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-data/pull/388))** — `equities_seq` never applied the fail / accept / drop policy: an unrescued ticker shipped with fabricated `total_shares` / `market_cap`, no refusal, no `data_quality` annotation, whatever `allow_truncation` said; its own test fixtures were silently exercising the gap | C | `generators/equities_seq/generator.py` (`generate`), `generators/equities/generator.py` (`_apply_incomplete_policy`) | — | High |
| APD-DATA-039 | SEC shares cache key is CIK-only — no version, TTL or mtime; a warm hit skips the concept loop and the rescue ladder and erases `quality` / `origin` provenance, so a `degraded` annotation fires on the cold day and vanishes the next while `end_date=None` mints a new `dataset_id` daily | R | `generators/equities/generator.py` (`_fetch_shares`: `_CACHE_DIR / "shares" / f"{int(cik):010d}.json"`, `if use_cache and cache.exists()`) | — | High |
| APD-DATA-040 | `_fetch_shares` keeps the latest-filed fact per period end, so a same-value re-statement re-dates history: 162 of 485 cached CIKs affected, 17,569 rows, ADM in the default prefix off by up to +11.55%; the same dedup defers the first available count for 9 CIKs (EXPE: 521 rows NaN where the figure was public) | C | `generators/equities/generator.py` (`_fetch_shares` — sort by `(end, filed)`, last write wins); instruments `util/ad-hoc/2026-09-08_equities_shares_cache_census/` | — | High |
| APD-DATA-041 | `adj_close` is a default feature column built with `auto_adjust=False`, so `close / adj_close` is a monotone channel of future cumulative dividends (91 distinct steps on cached AAPL) — a look-ahead by the module's own rule that no quantity unknowable at a row's date may reach that row | C | `generators/equities/generator.py` (`yf.download(..., auto_adjust=False)`, `"Adj Close": "adj_close"`), `equities/defaults.py` (`EQUITIES_FEATURE_COLUMNS`) | — | Med |
| APD-DATA-042 | `cost_basis` is a per-ticker constant written to every row, inert only at the default `purchase_date`; any later date is a full future-price leak, and `purchase_date` is a plain public request field (a text input in canopy's sidebar) | C | `generators/equities/generator.py` (`cost_basis` via `on_or_before(purchase_date)`), `equities/params.py` (`purchase_date`) | — | High |
| APD-DATA-043 | `_SHARES_OUTLIER_FACTOR` filters share points against a whole-history median, so which points survive depends on filings made after the affected rows (61 of 485 cached CIKs lose ≥1 point; 15 or 16 keep a different set under a causal median, definition-dependent); the `median > 0` guard also disables the filter for all-zero payloads | C | `generators/equities/generator.py` (`_SHARES_OUTLIER_FACTOR`, the median filter in `_fetch_shares`) | — | High |
| APD-DATA-044 | Six cached payloads carry placeholder share counts (TAP `0,0,0`; DDOG; CVNA; FOX/FOXA `val=1`; PSKY `[1000, 1000, real]`; BRK.B at Class-A scale) that pass every guard — not NaN, so `fundamentals_fill`, the empty-units guard and `data_quality` are all silent and `market_cap` is 0.0 or nonsense | R | `generators/equities/generator.py` (`_fetch_shares`, `_condition_one`); cache `~/.cache/juniper_data/equities/shares/` | — | High |
| APD-CASCOR-007 | **FIXED ([juniper-cascor#633](https://github.com/pcalnon/juniper-cascor/pull/633))** — `dataset_shortfall.accepted_via_allow_truncated_datasets` was the raw service setting, so it read `false` on a run training on partial data accepted by the caller's params or by the producer's own deployment default — an annotation denying the acceptance it annotated | C | `src/api/lifecycle/manager.py` (`_build_dataset_shortfall`, `_reload_dataset`) | — | High |
| APD-CASCOR-008 | `_PROJECT_API_TRUNCATABLE_GENERATORS` duplicates knowledge juniper-data owns, and two of its three members are unreachable: cascor's `dataset_type` Literal excludes `csv_import` and `equities_seq` | M | `src/cascor_constants/constants_api/constants_api_defaults.py`, `src/api/models/training.py` (the Literal) | — | High |
| APD-CASCOR-009 | `_auto_start_training` bypasses `_reload_dataset`: it never sets `dataset_shortfall` (an auto-started run on partial data reports `null`), forwards no truncation opt-in, and swallows its failure (`except Exception: logger.exception`), leaving the service healthy with no training | C | `src/api/app.py` (`_auto_start_training`) | — | High |
| APD-CASCOR-010 | `get_metrics()` / `/v1/metrics` carry no shortfall annotation, so a metric read without the status route carries no mark of the data behind it | E | `src/api/lifecycle/manager.py` (`get_metrics`) | — | High |
| APD-CASCOR-011 | `--allow-truncated-datasets` is inert on `main.py`'s own run path — it only exports the env var, and that entry point reaches only the in-process `spiral` problem, which cannot be partial | E | `src/main.py` (the flag), `src/api/lifecycle/manager.py` (the only reader) | — | High |
| APD-CASCOR-012 | No operator-facing document names `JUNIPER_CASCOR_ALLOW_TRUNCATED_DATASETS` or `--allow-truncated-datasets`: absent from `AGENTS.md`'s env-var table, `.env.example` and every `docs/*.md` (only `CHANGELOG.md` records the field) | E | `AGENTS.md`, `.env.example` | — | High |

**Park / actionable status of the open post-primer rows** (row-level sentences; a sentence here parks
or unparks its row and nothing else):

- `APD-DATA-039` — **actionable** for the versioned key + TTL; **the refresh horizon (how far back to
  regenerate) is an owner decision.**
- `APD-DATA-040`, `APD-DATA-041`, `APD-DATA-042`, `APD-DATA-043` — **parked: owner decision.** Each changes
  the artifact's content and needs a `generator_version` bump; first-publication vs latest-filed
  (`-040`) is a design choice, not a bug fix.
- `APD-DATA-044` — **parked: owner decision**, in the same batch as `-040`…`-043`: treating an all-zero or
  placeholder series as `unrescued` (like the empty-units case) is the obvious remedy, but it changes which
  universes pass the default `fail` policy, so it ships with the same `generator_version` bump.
- `APD-CASCOR-008` — **parked: owner decision** (derive the set from juniper-data's `/v1/generators`, or
  keep the list and narrow it to the reachable member).
- `APD-CASCOR-009`, `APD-CASCOR-010`, `APD-CASCOR-012` — **actionable**; one PR, the cascor#624 follow-ups.
- `APD-CASCOR-011` — **parked: design question** (drop the flag from `main.py`, or make that path reach
  a truncatable generator); file, do not silently remove.
