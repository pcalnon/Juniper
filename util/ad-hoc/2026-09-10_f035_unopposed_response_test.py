"""F-CANOPY-035 -- does an UNOPPOSED response land? The discriminator for supersession.

THE QUESTION, AND WHY THE EXISTING INSTRUMENTS CANNOT ANSWER IT.

``util/ad-hoc/2026-09-08_f035_supersession_test.py`` disables ``fast-update-interval``
and the store fills (``APPLIED-UNCONTENDED``, two replicates). That intervention
removes **all ten** callbacks on that Interval at once, so it cannot separate:

  H1  SUPERSESSION -- dash-renderer retires an in-flight call when the SAME callback
      is re-requested (``eDuplicates`` at dash_renderer.dev.js:3026 concatenates
      ``requested`` last, so the newcomer survives and the in-flight one is dropped;
      its response is discarded on arrival). Driven only by this callback's own
      re-request rate.
  H2  FAILED / ABORTED RESPONSE -- ``Callback failed: the server did not respond``
      appeared in 2 of 4 failing probe runs and none of the successful one
      (ledger, F-CANOPY-035). Produces the same signature and needs a different fix.
  H3  PROMOTION STARVATION -- the fast lane's other nine callbacks saturate the
      renderer so this one's output is never applied.

``2026-09-05_f035_store_write_latency_probe.py`` measures duration/gap/overlap but
brackets the store only at window START and END, so it can say "69% of writes were
overlapped" and cannot say whether the **31% that were not** landed. That 31% is the
load-bearing number: the ledger records nine unopposed responses in a window that
ended with ``len=0``, and supersession cannot explain a response nothing superseded.

WHAT THIS PROBE ADDS: a PER-RESPONSE bracket. Every invocation of the store's writer
is timed from its own request body, classified opposed / unopposed against the other
invocations' start times, and matched against a continuous in-page trace of the
store's length. That turns "the store was empty at the end" into "response #7 arrived
at t=12.4 s with 71 rows, nothing was in flight against it, and the store did not
move" -- which refutes H1 as a sufficient cause, or fails to.

THE OPPOSITION BOUNDARY -- corrected 2026-09-10 after run 1, from the shipped bundle.

Run 1 classified opposition by the next **HTTP request start** and returned
``SUPERSESSION-INSUFFICIENT`` on 25 of 25 unopposed responses failing to land. **That
verdict is an artifact of the wrong boundary and is superseded by this module.** Read
from ``dash_renderer.dev.js`` (the unminified bundle ships in JuniperCanopy1):

  :2676  a deferred callback enters ``watched`` when its fetch is initiated.
  :2698  on resolution it must STILL be in ``watched``:
         ``currentCb = find(cb => ..., watched); if (currentCb) {...}`` -- else the
         observer RETURNS and the result is discarded, never applied.
  :3027  ``wDuplicates = map(g => g.slice(0,-1), groupBy(getUniqueIdentifier,
         concat(watched, requested)))`` -- ``requested`` is concatenated LAST, so a
         newly REQUESTED invocation evicts the in-flight one from ``watched``.

So the displacing event is **a new entry in ``requested``**, created by the Interval
TICK -- which happens on the 1000 ms cadence whether or not the previous request has
even been sent. A response is vulnerable for its whole in-flight span, and the correct
question is "did a TICK fall inside this call's flight?", not "did another request
start inside it?". This probe therefore records ``fast-update-interval.n_intervals``
transitions and classifies on those.

It also explains a number the ledger read the other way: ``everSeen {watched: 1}`` --
two concurrent entries never observed -- was taken as evidence AGAINST supersession.
The eviction is synchronous with the insertion (one reducer pass), so two concurrent
entries can NEVER be observed. That observation is what this mechanism predicts.

Because ``getUniqueIdentifier`` hashes ONE callback's own inputs/outputs/state, the
other nine fast-lane callbacks are different identities and cannot appear in its
group -- so they cannot evict it. H3 is excluded at the source, not by an A/B.

VERDICT RULE -- FIXED BEFORE THE FIRST RUN UNDER THIS BOUNDARY, and deliberately not
a free parameter. (This arc has twice archived contradictory verdicts for one
phenomenon because the rule was edited after the data came in.)

  NO-WRITES               zero store-writing invocations observed -> the instrument
                          found nothing; its own control failed; no verdict.
  NO-TICK-TRACE           the tick counter was not observable -> the boundary cannot
                          be applied; no verdict.
  ALL-LANDED              every response landed -> the defect did not reproduce in
                          this window; no verdict on mechanism.
  NO-TICK-FREE            every response had a tick inside its flight -> consistent
                          with supersession but not discriminating on its own; the
                          quantitative prediction (duration vs 1000 ms) is reported.
  SUPERSESSION-INSUFFICIENT   >=1 TICK-FREE response did NOT land. Nothing could have
                          evicted it, so H1 does not account for the outcome.
  SUPERSESSION-CONSISTENT every tick-free response landed AND >=1 tick-crossed
                          response did not. The outcome tracks eviction exactly.

H2 is scored on a SEPARATE axis and never folded into the verdict above: console
errors are counted and correlated with non-landing responses by timestamp. A probe
that merges two hypotheses into one string cannot report that both fired.

PERTURBATION. Sampling the renderer changes the race it measures (ledger trap: an
``evaluate`` on a saturated topology page costs ~22 s, and the lifecycle probe's
per-notify ``JSON.stringify`` perturbed its own subject). So the store trace is taken
by an in-page Redux ``subscribe`` that reads ONE length and appends only on CHANGE,
plus a 1 Hz heartbeat to prove liveness -- harvested with a single ``evaluate`` after
the window closes. Network timing is taken on the Python side and touches the page
not at all.

POSITIVE CONTROL. The window ends by disabling ``fast-update-interval`` via
``setProps`` -- the 2026-09-08 intervention -- and expects the store to fill. If it
does not, the observer could not have seen a fill that occurred, and every zero above
is uninterpretable. Reported as ``control_fill``; a run whose control fails scores
CONTROL-FAILED regardless of anything else.

IDENTITY. Records the commit each leg SERVES (canopy and cascor ``/v1/health``) and
the page's own ``active_tab``, per the ledger's traps: a ``git_sha`` stamp lies when
the tree is dirty, and a browser artifact that names no tab cannot be read later
(F-CANOPY-051: the persisted tab is browser-global).
