Repair the juniper-cascor constants drift that cascor#633 left on `main`: export the four
SHORTFALL constants from the module's REAL ``__all__``, and delete the stray second one.

The defect, found by round-2 lane A on 2026-09-09
------------------------------------------------
`CI — juniper-cascor-model` has been RED on cascor `main` since `44dafe0` (cascor#633). Its
`tests/test_drift.py` requires `juniper-cascor-model/cascor_constants/` to be byte-identical to
`src/cascor_constants/`, and the two diverged by a seven-line block:

    __all__ = [ ...the four _PROJECT_API_SHORTFALL_* names... ]

present mid-file in the model copy only. That block was a CodeQL `py/unused-global-variable`
remedy, and it is wrong twice over. It broke the mirror; and it does not even work, because the
module already ends with its own full `__all__`, so the mid-file binding is REPLACED at import
time by the one at the end -- which never listed the four new names.

The repair, applied to BOTH copies identically:
  * delete the stray mid-file ``__all__``;
  * add the four names to the real ``__all__`` at the end of the file, in its existing
    alphabetical order (between ``_PROJECT_API_SERVICE_TERMINATION_TIMEOUT`` and
    ``_PROJECT_API_TLS_MIN_VERSION_DEFAULT``).

Nothing does ``from ... import *`` on this module (`constants_api/__init__.py` lists every name
explicitly), so ``__all__`` is documentation and a CodeQL signal here, never behaviour.
