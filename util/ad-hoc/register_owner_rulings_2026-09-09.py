Record the owner's rulings of 2026-09-09 on the open post-primer rows, and file the one new row
they produced.

Project: juniper-ml
Sub-Project: ad-hoc tooling
Author: Paul Calnon
Created: 2026-09-09
Status: ad-hoc — one-off
Retire when: RETAINED — ad-hoc scripts are kept as provenance of record (owner policy 2026-08-25)
Related: HANDOFF_2026-09-09_defect-register-round-38-the-three-way-prompt-shipped-and-two-corrections-that-reversed-themselves.md;
         util/ad-hoc/register_close_cascor640.py

Thirteen rulings, taken interactively. They END the empty set for the rows named below: a ruling
from the owner is the thing §2 says is required, and unlike the note withdrawn earlier today it is
not derived from a handoff or a PR body.

The rulings, and the evidence each was taken against:
  * `-039` + `-045`  versioned key + TTL + a staleness ANNOTATION, bound **365 days**. Chosen from
    the measured distribution (median last-as-of age 138 days, p90 180; 365d flags 27 of 485, and
    the curve is flat from 270d to 730d, so the exact number stops mattering).
  * `-040`  as-of join on FILED date: each trading row sees the latest fact filed on or before it.
  * `-041`  drop `adj_close` from the default feature columns; it stays requestable.
  * `-042`  make `cost_basis` causal — no basis on rows before `purchase_date`.
  * `-043`  causal (expanding-window) median PLUS an absolute floor.
  * `-044`  closed by that floor rather than a rule of its own. Floor = **100,000 shares**, chosen
    to sit above PSKY's 1,000 placeholders and below Berkshire's genuine Class-A low of 941,481.
  * `-046`  NEW, and the reason `-044` does not cover everything: Berkshire's numbers are REAL, so
    no floor can catch them. Filed now; the class-aware lookup is recorded as its remedy, deferred.
  * `-019`  implement filter/sort/limit pushdown in ALL stores.
  * `APD-CASCOR-008`  derive the truncatable set from juniper-data's `/v1/generators`.
  * `APD-CASCOR-011`  keep as cascor#640 shipped it; CLOSED as WON'T FIX, marker included.
  * `APD-CASCOR-013`  clear the annotation at the start of every run.

Not recorded here because it is a contract change rather than a defect row: option 3 becomes a
caller right via an explicit tri-state `allow_truncation: true | false | null`. That reverses the
premise of juniper-data's `test_request_cannot_opt_out_of_deployment_allow_truncation`, which pins
the behaviour the owner has now overruled — see the handoff and the partial-data arc memory.
