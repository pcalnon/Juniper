Close APD-CASCOR-009 / -010 / -012 against juniper-cascor#640, and record what it did to -011.

Project: juniper-ml
Sub-Project: ad-hoc tooling
Author: Paul Calnon
Created: 2026-09-09
Status: ad-hoc — one-off (refuses until cascor#640 reads MERGED)
Retire when: RETAINED — ad-hoc scripts are kept as provenance of record (owner policy 2026-08-25)
Related: juniper-cascor#640; util/ad-hoc/register_round38_round2_fixes.py (which filed these rows);
         HANDOFF_2026-09-09_defect-register-round-38-the-three-way-prompt-shipped-and-two-corrections-that-reversed-themselves.md

Four touches each (none of the three has a §3 detail entry): the §4.9 table row, a §5.1
verification row, the §2 status line, and the header date -- the protocol in §1 of the register.

`APD-CASCOR-011` is NOT closed. cascor#640 took a third path on it: the flag stays, and its
`--help`, a WARNING and the docs now say what it does and does not affect. The parked question was
*drop it or rewire the path*, and that is still owed a ruling, so the row stays open with what
shipped recorded on it.

On the authority for actioning these at all: the four cascor follow-ups were named as remaining
work in the owner's own commissioning message for this arc (2026-09-08), which is an owner
instruction. That is a different thing from the withdrawn §2 note, which tried to derive a licence
from a machine-written handoff citing a machine-written PR body -- see the note in §2.

Auto-start forwards the deployment opt-in only when the caller is silent, annotates the run through `_build_dataset_shortfall` with the right `acceptance_source`, and logs a refusal at ERROR with the remedy. All three give-up paths now set `_auto_start_failure`, surfaced as `auto_start_failure` on `get_status()`: a field named for a failure that stays `null` while the failure sits in a log is the denial cascor#633 removed. 23 arms in the new `test_auto_start_shortfall.py`. |\n"
    f"| APD-CASCOR-010 | `get_metrics()` / `/v1/metrics` carried no shortfall annotation | {PR} | `dataset_shortfall` added to the returned dict, `None` when clean, so a metric read carries the mark of the data behind it. `get_metrics_history` deliberately unchanged (its rows are per-epoch). The golden snapshot `metrics_post_train.json` is an exact-compare fixture of that payload and was recaptured — it is triple-gated behind `--slow --integration --golden` and silently skips otherwise, which is how a change here can look clean and break the golden lane. |\n"
    f"| APD-CASCOR-012 | No operator-facing document named the truncation knob | {PR} | `JUNIPER_CASCOR_ALLOW_TRUNCATED_DATASETS` added to `AGENTS.md`'s env table and `.env.example`, and both `/v1/training/status` and `/v1/metrics` field lists in `docs/api/JUNIPER_CASCOR_API_REFERENCE.md` updated for the annotation. The `--help` text was corrected in the same PR after review: it had explained the flag's inertness on `main.py` by saying the spiral data is generated locally and juniper-data is never contacted, which is false — `main.py` health-checks the service and refuses to start without it. The true reason is that `spiral` is not a truncatable generator. |\n"
