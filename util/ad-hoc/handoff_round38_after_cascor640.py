"""
Bring the archived round-38 handoff up to date once juniper-cascor#640 merged.

Project: juniper-ml
Sub-Project: ad-hoc tooling
Author: Paul Calnon
Created: 2026-09-09
Status: ad-hoc — one-off (companion to util/ad-hoc/register_close_cascor640.py; refuses until #640 is MERGED)
Retire when: RETAINED — ad-hoc scripts are kept as provenance of record (owner policy 2026-08-25)
Related: juniper-cascor#640; util/ad-hoc/register_close_cascor640.py

An archived handoff is normally left alone. This one is edited because it was archived while its
last piece of work was still in flight, and it carries three statements that the merge falsifies:
the register counts in its header and §1, an instruction telling the successor NOT to build the
CLI-flag item, and a §2 row plus a checklist line describing the PR as unbuilt. A handoff whose
"verify starting state" block prints the wrong numbers is worse than one that is merely incomplete.
