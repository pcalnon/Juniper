THE DAMAGE

`notes/legacy/CASCOR_DEMO_TRAINING_ERROR_PLAN.md:1046` reads

    # In _reset_state_and_history() or a network reset method:# Juniper Cascor Concurrency

That is TWO documents welded onto one line. The first half is this file's own idiom -- a
Python comment naming the method a snippet belongs in, exactly as at :350, :354 and :477,
each inside a well-formed ```python block. The second half, `# Juniper Cascor Concurrency`,
is the H1 of a DIFFERENT document that was appended here.

The ```python fence opened at :1045 therefore never receives its closer, and under
CommonMark it runs to the next bare ``` at :1205 -- swallowing **161 lines** of the
appended document, including ten H2 headings, and rendering them as Python on github.com.

WHY IT WAS NOT FOUND EARLIER

The screen's pre-2026-09-10 fence walk was a boolean toggle, which mis-modelled this file in
both directions: the 2026-09-09 review reported its damage at `:1454` ("swallowing the last
~97 lines"), and round 2 corrected that to "the toggle slips at :1200" and concluded the
file was BALANCED under CommonMark. Balanced it is -- the fence at :1045 does eventually
close at :1205. Balance was the wrong question. The right one is which lines land inside a
block, and 161 of them do.

Found only after the walker was made length- and info-string-aware, which is why this file
sat inside the set an owner was asked to ratify as benign.

THE REPAIR

Split the line at the seam and close the fence:

    # In _reset_state_and_history() or a network reset method:
    ```
    <blank>
    # Juniper Cascor Concurrency

Nothing is deleted and no wording changes; three lines are inserted and one is split. The
Python block keeps the comment it actually contains, and the appended document returns to
prose.
