Apply round-2 validation's corrections to the round-38 register filing.

Project: juniper-ml
Sub-Project: ad-hoc tooling
Author: Paul Calnon
Created: 2026-09-09
Status: ad-hoc — one-off (third and last of the round-38 register scripts)
Retire when: RETAINED — ad-hoc scripts are kept as provenance of record (owner policy 2026-08-25)
Related: util/ad-hoc/register_round38_file.py and register_round38_dates.py (the first two);
         reports/2026-09-09_round-38-consensus/ (the three lanes whose findings these apply);
         HANDOFF_2026-09-08_defect-register-round-38-the-three-way-prompt-built-and-the-annotation-made-truthful.md

Every change below was RE-DERIVED by the orchestrating session before being applied; a lane
finding is evidence, not an instruction. Two lane findings were themselves refuted and are NOT
applied (the "stale KO/ABT comment", which is the corrective comment data#388 added quoting the
claim it retracts; and a claimed latent bandit failure, which bandit 1.9.4 does not have because
B105 walks ``ast.Assign`` only).

The corrections:
  1. §2 note — DELETE the licensing clause. It asserted the unparked-implies-actionable
     equivalence §2 explicitly rejects, and drew authority from a machine-written handoff.
  2. §5.1 APD-CASCOR-007 — the mirror did NOT keep the drift test green; it broke it.
  3. §5.1 APD-DATA-038 — 228 passed was unreachable; the nine suites total 220.
  4. §4.9 APD-DATA-041 — "monotone" and "91 distinct steps" both withdrawn.
  5. §4.9 APD-DATA-043 — the inert ``median > 0`` clause out, the PSKY inversion in.
  6. §4.9 APD-DATA-044 — R -> C, restated at the DELIVERED level, BRK.B reclassified.
  7. §4.9 APD-CASCOR-009 — "bypasses _reload_dataset" narrowed to the fetch.
  8. §4.9 APD-CASCOR-010 — E -> C (the contract names metrics as a surface it must annotate).
  9. §4.9 APD-CASCOR-011 — "in-process spiral" is wrong; spiral goes over HTTP.
 10. Two new rows: APD-DATA-045 (stale forward-filled share counts) and APD-CASCOR-013
     (``_dataset_shortfall`` is never cleared).
 11. §4.9 preamble — the canopy findings are in a draft handoff, not in any ledger.
 12. The §2 status line — sixteen filed, thirteen open, 30 open in all.

    "`adj_close` is a default feature column built with `auto_adjust=False` — which overrides yfinance's own default of `True`, so this line alone creates the channel. `close / adj_close` declines to exactly 1.0 at the download date and carries a **1.13% adjustment on the last row of a window ending 2023-12-29**, a level fixed by dividends paid after that row: a look-ahead by the module's own rule that no quantity unknowable at a row's date may reach it.

Strictly harder to catch than `APD-DATA-044`'s zeros, because the resulting `market_cap` is plausible.
