#
# WHY A DRIVER
#
# The pair is several launches with settle gaps, and the control arm must carry EXACTLY the
# budget run_suite pins for the parallel arm (thread_budget_env at max_parallel 2 on 16 cores:
# OMP/MKL/OPENBLAS 2, CASCOR_NUM_PROCESSES 4) or the arms differ in budget, not only in
# concurrency, and compare_baseline's thread_budget identity would rightly refuse the comparison.
# Exporting the four variables here makes both arms identical on that axis (run_suite's own export
# for the parallel arm carries the same values) and the driver's manifests record what each cell
# actually ran under. One script, one log, one launch to kill.
#
# The occupancy sampler (2026-09-10_pf8_occupancy_sampler.py) is started SEPARATELY, before this,
# and attaches to every run dir this creates.
#
# Usage:
