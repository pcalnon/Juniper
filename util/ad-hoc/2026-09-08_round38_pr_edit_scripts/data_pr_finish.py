"""Round-38 juniper-data PR: finish the executor's work (comments, CHANGELOG) -- exact-match edits.

Project: juniper-ml
Sub-Project: ad-hoc tooling
Author: Paul Calnon
Created: 2026-09-08
Status: ad-hoc — one-off (applied once, on 2026-09-08, to the PR worktree named below; the paths inside are that session's)
Retire when: RETAINED — ad-hoc scripts are kept as provenance of record (owner policy 2026-08-25)
