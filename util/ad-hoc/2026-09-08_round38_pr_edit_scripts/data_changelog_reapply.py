"""Re-apply the two CHANGELOG edits on top of origin/main's CHANGELOG.md (session scratch).

Project: juniper-ml
Sub-Project: ad-hoc tooling
Author: Paul Calnon
Created: 2026-09-08
Status: ad-hoc — one-off (applied once, on 2026-09-08, to the PR worktree named below; the paths inside are that session's)
Retire when: RETAINED — ad-hoc scripts are kept as provenance of record (owner policy 2026-08-25)
Related: juniper-data#388 (worktree juniper-data--fix--equities-seq-deployment-defaults-and-incomplete-policy--20260908-0730--03b7548f);
