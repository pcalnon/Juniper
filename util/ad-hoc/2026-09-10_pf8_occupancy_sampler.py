Sample an experiment run's process trees from /proc at 1 s and write cpu-seconds per wall-second per role — the occupancy of one Juniper run, in cores.

Project: juniper-ml
Sub-Project: ad-hoc tooling
Author: Paul Calnon
Created: 2026-09-10
Status: ad-hoc — investigation (perf lane P2 item 4.1 residue: the PF-8 occupancy probe, step 1 of §1.3 of the 2026-09-08 re-scope note)
Retire when: RETAINED — ad-hoc scripts are kept as provenance of record (owner policy 2026-08-25)

WHY THIS EXISTS

§8.4 of the 2026-09-02 instrument-resolution note locates the contention knee in SYNTHETIC-WORKER
units (one worker = one saturated core), and §1.3 of the 2026-09-08 re-scope note says PF-8's
marginal value is finding where one Juniper run sits on that axis. Nothing records it: the driver's
manifest carries nproc and the thread env, not what the run actually consumed, and `ps %CPU` is a
lifetime average (cputime / elapsed) — useless for a 60 s window. This reads `/proc/<pid>/stat`
utime+stime for every process in the run's trees once a second and writes the deltas, so the mean
over the training window is the run's core occupancy; reading that as sweep workers is an
assumption, stated below.

WHAT IT SAMPLES

It watches the run root for run directories created after it started (the launcher writes
`ports.json` at `--up`, then `juniper-data.pid` / `juniper-cascor.pid` once each service has
answered health) and, for each, walks the process table:

    cascor_uvicorn     the recorded cascor listener pid
    cascor_forkserver  its child whose cmdline names the multiprocessing forkserver
    cascor_workers     every descendant of the forkserver (the candidate pool)
    cascor_other       any other descendant of the listener
    cascor_tree        the sum of the four above  <- the figure §1.3 asks for
    data               the juniper-data listener and its descendants
    driver             run_experiment.py for this run dir, and its descendants
    total              cascor_tree + data + driver
    host_busy_cores    (busy / total) jiffies from /proc/stat x nproc — the WHOLE host, ours and
                       everyone else's; ambient occupancy = host_busy_cores - total / wall_dt

Every cpu column is cpu-seconds spent in the interval; divide by `wall_dt` for occupancy in CORES.
Equating one core with one sweep worker is an assumption §8.4 of the sweep note disclaims (the
knee is located in worker count, not cores). A pid born inside an interval is counted from birth (`starttime` against the
previous tick's uptime); a pid that exits inside one loses its final partial second, which
`vanished` counts so the loss can be bounded. Rows with `run_id -` are host-only ticks between
cells and give the ambient trace.

Run it in the background BEFORE launching the suite and stop it by the pid `--pid-file` records —
never `kill $!` after `setsid nohup` (that is the wrapper), and never `pkill -f` on a pattern your
own shell's command line matches:

    python3 util/ad-hoc/2026-09-10_pf8_occupancy_sampler.py --out SUITE_DIR/occupancy.tsv --pid-file PATH.pid &
    ...
    kill "$(cat PATH.pid)"          # or: touch the --stop-file

Reduce with util/ad-hoc/2026-09-10_pf8_occupancy_analyse.py.
