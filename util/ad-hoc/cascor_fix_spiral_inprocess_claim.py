Correct cascor#640's explanation of WHY --allow-truncated-datasets is inert on main.py.

The PR's conclusion is right and its reason is wrong. It says main.py "trains the in-process
two-spiral problem, which is synthesised locally ... it never asks juniper-data for anything".
main.py does ask: it resolves ``juniper_data_url``, health-checks ``/v1/health`` and REFUSES to
proceed when the service is unreachable, printing how to start it; ``SpiralDataProvider`` then
fetches over HTTP through ``JuniperDataClient``.

What actually makes the flag inert is narrower and more useful to an operator: the generator on
this path is hardcoded ``spiral``, and ``spiral`` is not in
``_PROJECT_API_TRUNCATABLE_GENERATORS`` — juniper-data synthesises it server-side and always
delivers it in full, so no shortfall can arise for the flag to act on. Same conclusion, a reason
that survives reading the code.

This matters beyond tidiness: the wrong reason tells an operator main.py has no juniper-data
dependency, which would send them the wrong way when the pre-flight check fails.
